# Math142FinalProject
Repository for Math 142 Final Project Group 9: Fox, Lucas, Marie, Matthew, Sophia. Contains code and data used to generate models.

The data folder contains all data we used for our models and the images folder contains some of our results/images.

Most code written in Python with some written in MatLab.

BiLang.m and BiLangMod.m mainly focus on the initial SIR model we did.

language_acquisition.py and abram-strogatz.py are the preliminary models we did to get a rough idea of how to further expand upon these in the future.

The AS Model Code folder holds all the final AS models we made while implementing new factors/methodology.
